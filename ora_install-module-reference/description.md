# Description

The `ora_install` module contains all Puppet classes, defined types and custom types needed to install Oracle RDBMS and Oracle ASM on a system. Instead of writing complex Bash scripts, using this module, you can now define your Oracle software installation in an easy declarative way. In the paragraph Functionality, we will give you small examples on how you can use these Puppet classes and types.

All knowledge required to install and manage your Oracle installation is coded into our software. For our customers, it means they can focus on the "what" and leave the implementation details to our modules.

Our modules support a broad range of Oracle versions. We are committed to making our modules work on future releases. This allows our customers an easy upgrade path from older to newer versions.
